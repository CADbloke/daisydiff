#summary Existing software solutions in Java.

= Finding differences in Text =

The diff problem for pure text is considered solved more or less. There are several
implementations which offer high quality results at minimal cost. Open-source
solutions (especially *GNU diff*) are also available.

It is also worth noting that in several cases we are not interested in word-level diffs but only on line changes. Typical examples include Source Code Management systems or Wiki applications. This makes the job of a text diff library very easy.

Fine-grained differences at the character level are also possible. *Google diff* for example can show differences in characters. For example it can understand that _horse_ and _horses_ differ in one character only.

= Finding differences in XML/HTML =

Comparing two XHTML files is a completely different story. HTML holds tree structured data so the problem is no longer trivial. A diff library must be essentially "smart" in order to understand what is an html tag and what is not. Changes can now happen in HTML attributes apart from simple text. HTML also contains advanced constructs likes lists and tables which complicate the output code.  

HTML found in the wild can also be very rough for a diff library. Some pre-processing code is needed that cleans up the HTML before the actual comparison takes place.

There is a lot of research and literature on XML diffing methods. Unlike pure text, a definitive solution has not yet appeared.
