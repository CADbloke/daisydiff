<p>Google is hosting a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a>
again!</p>

<h1>Students</h1>

<p>What does that mean? Well, if you are a student, and your proposal qualifies,
and your contribution is considered worthwhile, then you can get paid to
contribute to open source projects such as Daisy: 4500 US$, no less! You'll find
much more information about the program in the Google SoC
<a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode/studentfaq.php">Student FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>People coming from classic office environments are easily lured into the benefits of centralized content management by the ease of use of the daisy wysiwyg editor.  Without losing a recognisable content authoring environment they are happy to find:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You must not overbook a plane. Working on your Daisy project should be your
main activity for the entire winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> provide regular showers (weekly or
bi-weekly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be expected to learn about source code control and open source
collaboration tools (in Daisy's case, that's Subversion and mailing lists,
mainly).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to submit your proposal</h2>


<p>It is a good idea to discuss your proposal on the Daisy mailing list before
submitting it (do not write to the mentors directly). This will for sure give
your proposal a better chance of being accepted. To write to the mailing list,
you need to subscribe to it. The <a href="daisy:45-cd">community page</a>
contains all the details.

<p>The SoC student ugly myspace page is available
<a href="ftp://code.google.com/soc/student_step1.html">from here</a>.</p>


<h5>Suggested project ideas for 2015</h5>

<pre class="query">select name where $DaisyCommWikiCategory = 'gsoc2007proposal'
order by name option style_hint='bullets'</pre>

<p>Below is a list of some work area ideas. Please keep in mind that it is you -
the student - who needs to file a proposal with Google SoC, so our list isn't
exhaustive or limiting.</p>


<h1>The mentors</h1>

<ul>
<li>Steven Noels</li>
<li>Marc Portier</li>
<li>Kuifje</li>
<li>Paul Focke</li>
<li>Bruno Dumon</li>
<li>me?</li>
</ul>

<h1>The student</h1>

<p>Much like a source code version control system, in Daisy a version history of
documents is kept. Being able to compare the content of these versions is very
useful. Currently the diffs shown in Daisy are based on the HTML source text
(just try Page Action -&gt; Versions in the menu on top of this page to see an
example). It would be very nice to have graphical diffs instead, thus simply a
HTML document with changes, additions and deletions marked (a bit like the
change tracking in word processors).</p>

<p>Thank you guy!</p>
