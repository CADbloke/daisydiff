<h1>HTML DIFF PROJECT:</h1>

<p><a href="daisy:382-cd">(the original idea)</a></p>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>The goal of the "HTML diff" project is to provide a Java library that
compares XML files. The minimum inputs are 2 XML files, and the minimum output
file is a Java representation of the basic operations that turned the first data
structure into the second.&nbsp; This output can be converted to an XML-based
representation or, given the proper formatting guidelines (in a yet undecided
data type), into an html file with a certain syntax to denote changes. <br/>
In addition, distance metrics can be computed that allow the user to quantify by
how much 2 files differ. This enables them to distinguish minor from major
changes, and tells them what the (chronological) relationships are between 3
files. For computing the changes there can be several algorithms:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;A simple LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) implementation that will work on
plain text or simple HTML files. This algorithm is the algorithm used in the
Unix "diff" command, in CVS, patch, etc. It's computationally the best algorithm
but it will destroy complex XML hierarchies. There are many open source
implementations available of this algorithm. For instance the Wikipedia and
Drupal software uses LCS, as does the current text-based implementation in
Daisy.</li>
<li>A more complicated graph algorithm that uses a greedy method to compute a
difference but not the optimal one. this can be optimal for XML files with
little reproduction.</li>
<li>A complex algorithm with perfect accurateness.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these possibilities there are papers that describe algorithms.
<br/>
There should also be an option that chooses the optimal algorithm for a given
XML file at runtime (based on length, complexity, leafs, ...)</p>

<h2>WHAT'S IN IT FOR DAISY:</h2>

<p>The current implementation in Daisy is very basic and not intuitive for the
average user. When for example a dot is added to the end of a sentence, the
entire line of html is removed and added with the extra dot. It would be better
to indicate in the margin that a change took place at that line, and then show&nbsp;
the added dot. For removed pieces of code there can be an inline icon of sorts
that can expand to show the removed data. Changes can be played like a movie
(see</p>

<p>In general the fact that html tags are shown on the compare page makes it not
very user friendly. When a column is removed from a table you will see alot of
removed lines of code in the entire table structure, when it actualy took just
one basic action. (see
<a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisyscratchpad/393-cd/version/1/diff?otherVersion=2">http://cocoondev.org/daisyscratchpad/393-cd/version/1/diff?otherVersion=2</a>
for example)</p>

<p>In time the library could be used to compare more than just the scratchpad
html. The possibilities are endless really. The integration with daisy itself
however is beyond the scope of this project and needs brainstorming with the
entire community.</p>

<h2>DELIVERABLES:</h2>

<ul>
<li>A literature study with an outline of all the possible algorithms + Testing
of existing (proprietary) code. + Explaing the algorithms on the community
scratchpad</li>
<li>A study of the XML files used by DaisyCMS, which I would need to prioritize
on. (Do we want to compare ordered or unordered XML files?)</li>
<li>A LCS implementation (could be copied from the current Daisy codebase?)</li>
<li>A HTML respresentation/change syntax that can be used for DaisyCMS</li>
<li>One or more graph-based implementations</li>
<li>A library with all the options from the project description</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>TIME LINE:</h2>

<p>June 1st - June 30th: Given the fact that in Belgium the exam period ends
somewhere in the of June this will be my least productive period of the summer:
Getting to know Daisy, and the literature study will be all I can cope with.</p>

<p>July 1st - July 16th: To make up for the slow month of June, I will work day
and night to finish the LCS Implementation and the HTML representation.</p>

<p>July 16th - July 26th: A well deserved vacation in Greece.</p>

<p>July 27th - August 15th: One or more graph algorithms.</p>

<p>August 15th - August 31st: Finish the package, complete as much documentation
as possible before the final deadline.</p>

<p>September 1st - September 25th: Integrate the package into DaisyCMS and
finish the unfinished.</p>

<h2>BIO:</h2>

<p>todo<br/>
+ I'd like to work in the offices in Ghent<br/>
+ I'd like to do this as an internship for my university (how's that for a
guaranteed commitment; at least i wont run away after the initial payment)</p>
