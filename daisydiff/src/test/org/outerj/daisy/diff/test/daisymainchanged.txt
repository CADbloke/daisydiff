<h2>What is Daisy?</h2>
 
<p align="center"><img src="daisy:459-cd"/></p>
 
<p>Daisy is a content management system that offers rich out-of-the-box
functionality combined with solid foundations for extensibility and integration.
Daisy consists of two main components:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>a stand-alone repository server accessible through HTTP/XML (using the
<a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">ReST</a> style
of WebServices) and/or a high-level (remote) Java API, and</li>
<li>an extensive editing and publishing front-end web application running inside
<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Apache Cocoon</a>.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Due to its genericity and flexibility, Daisy can be used for many different
purposes, but is ideally suited for information-rich, structured content and
asset management applications. Even for advanced content management
applications, Daisy can be used and configured without any Java-coding skills:
Daisy offers a Javascript/Cocoon-based extension framework.</p>
 
<p>Daisy is licensed under the open source, business-friendly Apache License
2.0. Enjoy!</p>
 
<h2>Getting started</h2>
 
<p>Daisy is used to host its own documentation website: browse around and learn
about its features. If you are interested to know more about Daisy's
administrative and editing screens, we've put up a number of
<a href="daisy:53-cd">screenshots</a>. Also, you can easily install and run
Daisy to give it a try and see if it works out for your project.</p>
 
<p>Daisy's default browsing and editing application can easily be adapted to
your web look-and-feel: its XSLT-based templating system provides ultimate
freedom and flexibility.</p>
 
<p>Daisy is an open source project: your <a href="daisy:45-cd">contributions</a>
are warmly welcomed.</p>
 
<h2>The project</h2>
 
<p>Before its initial release on October 12<sup>th</sup> 2004, Daisy has been
under active development for almost 10 months. Its initial development has been
funded primarily by <a href="http://www.schaubroeck.be/">Schaubroeck</a> - its
implementation has been done by
<a href="http://outerthought.org/">Outerthought</a>. Almost three years later
now, Daisy counts 10+ releases, and is the center of a thriving ecosphere, with
consistent and structural support by several companies and a healthy user
community.</p>
 
<p>We solicit contributions, either through code or through funding, from other
parties interested in this development model. Outerthought has considerable
experience in doing open source framework development as a foundation for
commercial products. This way, users cannot only implement Daisy for their
specific projects, but they can also support and steer direction of future Daisy
development. We are also available for project-specific Daisy add-ons, making
sure Daisy does exactly what you need for your particular requirements.</p>
