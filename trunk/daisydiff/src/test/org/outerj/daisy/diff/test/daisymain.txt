<h2>What is it?</h2>
 
<p>Daisy is a comprehensive content management application framework, consisting
of a standalone repository server accessible through HTTP/XML (using the
<a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">ReST</a> style
of WebServices) and/or a high-level (remote) Java API, and an extensive browsing
and editing DaisyWiki application running inside
<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Apache Cocoon</a>. Daisy is licensed under
the commercially-friendly Apache License 2.0. Outerthought provides commercial
services around Daisy. More marketing talk can be obtained
<a href="http://outerthought.org/daisy.html">from their website</a>. This is the
Daisy community website, with access to downloads and the full documentation.
Enjoy!</p>
 
<h2>Getting started</h2>
 
<p>Daisy is used to host its own documentation website: browse around and learn
all about its features. If you are interested to know more about Daisy's
administrative and editing screens, we've put up a number of
<a href="daisy:53">screenshots</a>. Also, you can easily
<a href="daisy:13">install</a> and run Daisy to give it a try and see if it
works out for your project.</p>
 
<p>Daisy's default browsing and editing application can easily be adapted to
your web look-and-feel: an XSLT-based skinning system requires no Java
programming knowledge to adapt the DaisyWiki layout, and is much safer than r
equiring people to mess around in JSP template files.</p>
 
<p>Daisy is an open source project: your <a href="daisy:45">contributions</a>
are warmly welcomed.</p>
 
<h2>The project</h2>
 
<p>Daisy has been under active development for almost 10 months before being
released as an <a href="daisy:44">open source</a> project on October
12<sup>th</sup> 2004. The initial development has been funded by
<a href="http://www.schaubroeck.be/">Schaubroeck</a> - the implementation has
been done by <a href="http://outerthought.org/">Outerthought</a>. Outerthought
is an open source XML &amp; Java competence support center, which has two main
areas of business: mentoring and coaching of budding Java/XML developers, and
open source framework development.</p>

<p>We sollicit contributions, either through code or through funding, from other
companies interested in this development model. Outerthought has considerable
experience in doing open source framework development as a foundation for
commercial products. This way, users cannot only implement Daisy for their
specific projects, but they can also support and steer direction of future Daisy
development. We are also available for project-specific Daisy add-ons, making
sure Daisy does exactly what you need for your particular requirements.</p>
